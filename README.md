## 🤖 Meet the Agents  

BitWakeScan operates through four specialized AI Agents — each one focused on a distinct layer of blockchain analysis:  

- 🧠 **Analyzer Agent** — token scans, anomaly detection, contract safety checks  
- 👛 **Wallet Tracker Agent** — monitors whale activity, wallet clusters, and recursive transfers  
- 🌐 **Social Scanner Agent** — tracks narratives, sentiment shifts, and media-driven market moves  
- 💧 **Liquidity Strateg Agent** — analyzes liquidity flows, pool depth, and strategic trading scenarios

## 🛠 Custom Agent Builder  

Beyond the foundation agents, BitWakeScan offers a **Custom Agent Builder** — allowing users to combine different intelligence layers into one personalized AI assistant.  

Examples:  
- **Analyzer + Wallet Tracker** → forensic-grade monitoring of suspicious wallet behaviors  
- **Social Scanner + Liquidity Strateg** → narrative-driven liquidity tracking  
- **Full Stack** (all four agents) → a 360° blockchain activity radar  

⚡️ With the Custom Agent Builder, you design **your own AI-powered scanner**, tuned to your trading style — whether that’s forensic tracing, market hunting, or liquidity mapping.
